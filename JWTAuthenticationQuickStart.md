# JWT Authentication Quick Start


API services tied to entitled Adobe products (e.g. Campaign, Target, etc.) require a JSON Web Token (JWT) in order to retrieve access tokens for usage against authenticated endpoints. This document serves as a quickstart guide for first-time users.

### Things to check before you start:

You are an organizational admin for your enterprise organization with the appropriate Adobe products entitled. (Check at https://adminconsole.adobe.com/{your_org_id}@AdobeOrg/overview)

### Steps to get a JWT and an access token:

1. Create a new integration in Adobe I/O Console [https://console.adobe.io/integrations](https://console.adobe.io/integrations)

![Create integration](../img/auth_jwtqs_01.png "Create integration") 

2. Choose to access an API.

3. Subscribe to an entitled product (for instance, Adobe Campaign).

![Subscribe service](../img/auth_jwtqs_02.png "Subscribe service")

4. Confirm that you want to create a new integration.

5. Create a private key and public certificate. Make sure you store these securely.

`openssl req -x509 -sha256 -nodes -days 365 -newkey rsa:2048 -keyout private.key -out certificate_pub.crt`

6. Upload the public certificate (certificate_pub.crt) as a part of creating the integration.

![Upload public certificate](../img/auth_jwtqs_03.png "Upload public certificate")

7. Your integration should now be created with the appropriate public certificate and claims.

![Integration created](../img/auth_jwtqs_04.png "Integration created")

8. Go to the JWT tab and paste in you private key to generate a JWT.

![JWT tab](../img/auth_jwtqs_05.png "JWT tab")

9. Use the sample curl to get your first access token. 

![Get Access Token](../img/auth_jwtqs_06.png "Get access token")

The example curl sends a POST request to [https://ims-na1.adobelogin.com/ims/exchange/jwt](https://ims-na1.adobelogin.com/ims/exchange/jwt) with the following parameters.

| Parameter | Description|
|---|---|
| `client_id`     | The API key generated for your integration. Find this on the I/O Console for your integration.|
| `client_secret` | The client secret generated for your integration. Find this on the I/O Console for your integration.|
| `jwt_token`     | A base-64 encoded JSON Web Token that encapsulates the identity of your integration, signed with a private key that corresponds to a public key certificate attached to the integration. Generate this on the I/O Console in the JWT Tab for your integration.| 

You now have your access token. Look up documentation for the specific API service youâ€™re hitting authenticated endpoints for to find what other parameters are expected. Most of them need an x-api-key which will be the same as your client id.
