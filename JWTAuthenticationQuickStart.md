# JWT Authentication Quick Start


API services tied to entitled Adobe products (such as Campaign, Target, Launch, and others) require a JSON Web Token (JWT) to retrieve access tokens for usage against authenticated endpoints. This document serves as a quickstart guide for first-time users.

## Things to check before you start:

You must be an organizational admin for your enterprise organization with the appropriate Adobe products entitled. (Check at https://adminconsole.adobe.com/{your\_org\_id}@AdobeOrg/overview)

## Steps to get a JWT and an access token

Regardless of your platform, you begin with the same steps in Adobe I/O Console:

1. Create a new integration in Adobe I/O Console: [https://console.adobe.io/integrations](https://console.adobe.io/integrations)
    ![Create integration](../img/auth_jwtqs_01.png "Create an integration") 

2. Choose to access an API.

3. Subscribe to an entitled product (for instance, Launch, by Adobe).
    ![Subscribe service](../img/auth_jwtqs_02.png "Subscribe to a product or service")

4. Confirm that you want to create a new integration.

5. Create a private key and a public certificate. Make sure you store these securely.

Once you complete the above steps, your path diverges depending on your platform: 

_**MacOS and Linux:**_

Open a terminal and execute the following command:  

`openssl req -x509 -sha256 -nodes -days 365 -newkey rsa:2048 -keyout private.key -out certificate_pub.crt`

![Generate public certificate](../img/auth_jwtqs_00.png "Generate Public certificate")

_**Windows:**_

1. Download an OpenSSL client to generate public certificates; for example, you can try the [OpenSSL Windows client](https://bintray.com/vszakats/generic/download_file?file_path=openssl-1.1.1-win64-mingw.zip).

2. Extract the folder and copy it to the C:/libs/ location.

3. Open a command line window and execute the following commands:

    `set OPENSSL_CONF=C:/libs/openssl-1.1.1-win64-mingw/openssl.cnf`

    `cd C:/libs/openssl-1.1.1-win64-mingw/`

    `openssl req -x509 -sha256 -nodes -days 365 -newkey rsa:2048 -keyout private.key -out certificate_pub.crt`

    ![Generate public certificate windows](../img/auth_jwtqs_000.png "Generate Public certificate windows")

Once you&rsquo;ve complete the steps for your chosen platform, continue in the Adobe I/O Console:

6. Upload the public certificate (certificate_pub.crt) as a part of creating the integration.
    ![Upload public certificate](../img/auth_jwtqs_03.png "Upload public certificate")

7. Your integration should now be created with the appropriate public certificate and claims.
    ![Integration created](../img/auth_jwtqs_04.png "Integration created")

8. Go to the JWT tab and paste in you private key to generate a JWT.
    ![JWT tab](../img/auth_jwtqs_05.png "JWT tab")

9. Copy the &ldquo;Sample CURL Command&rdquo; to get your first access token. 
    ![Get access token](../img/auth_jwtqs_06.png "Get access token")

10. Open Postman, then click Import &gt; Paste Raw Text and paste the copied curl command.
    ![Postman import](../img/auth_jwtqs_07.png "Postman import")

11. Click Send.
    ![Postman send](../img/auth_jwtqs_08.png "Postman send")

The example curl sends a POST request to [https://ims-na1.adobelogin.com/ims/exchange/jwt](https://ims-na1.adobelogin.com/ims/exchange/jwt) with the following parameters.

| Parameter | Description|
|---|---|
| `client_id` | The API key generated for your integration. Find this on the I/O Console for your integration. |
| `client_secret` | The client secret generated for your integration. Find this on the I/O Console for your integration. |
| `jwt_token` | A base-64 encoded JSON Web Token that encapsulates the identity of your integration, signed with a private key that corresponds to a public key certificate attached to the integration. Generate this on the I/O Console in the JWT Tab for your integration. Note that this token has the expiration time parameter `exp` set to 24 hours from when the token is generated. | 

You now have your access token. Look up documentation for the specific API service for which youâ€™re hitting authenticated endpoints to find what other parameters are expected. Most of them need an `x-api-key`, which will be the same as your `client_id`.
